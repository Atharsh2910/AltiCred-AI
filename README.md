    AltiCred AI

AltiCred AI is a modern solution aimed for underbanked class of population, enabling them to get Financial Inclusivity.

    income patterns, lifestyle). <br>
• Integrates social trust network analysis (Digital Trust Graph Score) and financial 
    recovery patterns for dynamic risk scoring. <br>
• Supports underbanked populations by offering explainable credit decisions even in the 
    absence of a credit bureau history. <br>
